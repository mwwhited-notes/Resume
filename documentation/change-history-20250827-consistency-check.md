# Change History - August 27, 2025 (Resume Consistency Check)
## Comprehensive Resume Ecosystem Consistency Update

### Session Objective
Execute the consistency-check protocol to ensure all resume files remain consistent with the gold standard (master-resume.md), maintain proper positioning, and follow style guide requirements.

### Changes Made

#### 1. NuGet Download Figure Updates (Critical Consistency Fix)
**Issue Identified:** Inconsistent download figures across resume ecosystem
- **Outdated Figures:** Multiple files contained "650K+" downloads
- **Current Figure:** Master resume shows 657,373+ exact downloads (should be 657K+ in presentation documents per style guide)

**Files Updated (18 files):**
```
Core Resume Files:
- resumes/comprehensive.md: 650K+ → 657K+
- resumes/abbreviated.md: 650K+ → 657K+ (2 instances)
- resumes/extended.md: 650K+ → 657K+

ATS Files:
- resumes/ats/generic.txt: 650K+ → 657K+ (4 instances)
- resumes/ats/leverco.md: 650K+ → 657K+
- resumes/ats/workday.md: 650K+ → 657K+

- profiles/cover-letter.md: 650K+ → 657K+ (2 instances)
```

#### 2. Professional Positioning Corrections
**Issue:** Several files had incorrect title positioning
- **Protocol Requirement:** All non-master files should target "Principal Platform Architect" exclusively

**Profile Positioning Updates:**
```
- profiles/brief.md: "Chief Solutions Architect" → "Principal Platform Architect"
- profiles/brief-personal.md: "Chief Solutions Architect" → "Principal Platform Architect"

```

**ATS Positioning Updates:**
```

- resumes/ats/workday.md: "Principal Solutions Architect" → "Principal Platform Architect" (multiple instances)
```

#### 3. Core Differentiators Order Correction
**Issue:** Platform Architecture Excellence not leading in extended.md
