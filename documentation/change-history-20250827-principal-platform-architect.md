# Change History - August 27, 2025 (Principal Platform Architect Update)
## Resume Default Target Job Title Update & Positioning Strategy Implementation

### Session Objective
Update default target job title to Principal Platform Architect while ensuring resume ecosystem consistency and implementing proper Master Resume vs Other Resume positioning strategy.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Protocol Enhancement (`protocols/consistency-check.md`)
**Updated Positioning Strategy:**
```
**CRITICAL: Master Resume vs Other Resume Positioning Strategy**
- **Master Resume:** Must list ALL target job titles showing multi-track capability (Principal Platform Architect, Fractional CTO, Principal Solutions Architect & Crisis Resolution Specialist)
- **All Other Resume Documents:** Must target SINGLE title only (currently Principal Platform Architect)
- **Profile Documents:** Must target SINGLE title only (currently Principal Platform Architect)
- **Rationale:** Master resume serves as authoritative source showing all capabilities, while presentation documents focus on single target for clarity and impact
```

#### 2. Master Resume Updates (`resumes/master-resume.md`)
**Professional Identity Enhanced:**
- Updated to show all target positions: "Principal Platform Architect, Fractional CTO, Principal Solutions Architect & Crisis Resolution Specialist"
- Enhanced Multi-Track Leadership Profile with Principal Platform Architect as primary focus
- Added platform engineering excellence and DevOps infrastructure mastery to Core Differentiators
- Maintained comprehensive capability demonstration for all roles

**Platform Architecture Positioning:**
- **Platform Architecture Excellence:** Enterprise platform engineering with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and 77% cloud cost reduction through strategic platform optimization
- **DevOps Infrastructure Mastery:** Advanced container orchestration, infrastructure as code, microservices architecture, and enterprise platform frameworks

#### 3. Core Resume Files - Single Title Focus
**Files Updated to Principal Platform Architect Only:**
- ✅ `resumes/comprehensive.md` - Updated summary and core differentiators
- ✅ `resumes/abbreviated.md` - Focused on Principal Platform Architect positioning
- ✅ `resumes/extended.md` - Single title focus with platform engineering emphasis

**Key Changes Applied:**
- Professional summary updated to emphasize "platform integrations" and "platform architecture"
