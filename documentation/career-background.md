  - Large companies that hide problems too well to value solutions
  - **Enterprise Architect Roles:** Too abstract and documentation-heavy, prefer hands-on technical architecture
  - **Startups/VC-Backed/High-Growth Companies:** High risk, unstable environments with unrealistic expectations
  - **Industry Exclusions:** Fintech/financial technology, blockchain/cryptocurrency, cannabis industry, marketing/advertising technology, government contractors
  - **Big Tech Companies:** Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Netflix, Oracle (too old for big tech culture)
  - **Cultural Mismatches:** Microsoft Corporation, Salesforce (CEO/culture not aligned), companies with ageist hiring practices
  - **Investor-Associated Companies:** Companies associated with Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen (a16z) - 1500+ excluded companies
  - **Youth-Oriented Cultures:** Environments that prioritize youth over senior expertise and experience
  
- **Strongly Interested In:**
  - Complex problem consulting (scheduled, not emergency)
  - SOW review and technical contract evaluation - preventing vendor abuse and overspending
  - Technology advisory for growing companies who need guidance but not full-time CTO

  - **Age-Appropriate Environments:** Companies that value senior technical expertise and decades of pattern recognition
  - **Professional Cultures:** Mature organizations with established practices that respect experienced professionals

### Engagement Model Flexibility
- **Scope Range:** From reviewing a statement of work (few days) to CEO on-retainer advisory (ongoing)
- **Client Size:** Focused on companies with need but perhaps not full-time CTO budget
- **Industry Agnostic:** "All industries have the same problems" - broad applicability of expertise
