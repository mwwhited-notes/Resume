# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**Wind River Presales Chief Architect & Solutions, Emerging Technologies**

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of mission-critical systems leadership, having served as CTO for FDA-compliant life sciences systems supporting Big Pharma clients (Sanofi, AstraZeneca, GSK) while architecting enterprise-scale infrastructures and leading technical enablement across 125+ developers. My expertise spans the exact technologies Wind River needs—Linux/Unix systems, Kubernetes orchestration, multi-cloud platforms, and AI/ML integration—combined with proven presales experience delivering rapid solutions (1-week AI/ML delivery vs 12 months of failed attempts) and optimizing enterprise costs (77% reductions). I'm particularly drawn to Wind River's 40-year leadership in aerospace, defense, automotive, and telecommunications intelligent systems, where my regulatory compliance experience and emerging technologies innovation can drive meaningful growth in these mission-critical markets. My unique combination of executive technology leadership, comprehensive presales expertise, and proven track record in crisis resolution—demonstrated through 652K+ NuGet downloads, 22,433+ Stack Overflow reputation, and FDA audit success—positions me to accelerate Wind River's continued innovation while supporting enterprise clients' most challenging intelligent systems transformations.
