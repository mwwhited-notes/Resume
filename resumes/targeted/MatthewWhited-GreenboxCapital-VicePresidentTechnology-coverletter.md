Dear Greenbox Capital Executive Team,

As a Fractional CTO with 20+ years leading enterprise technology strategy and building high-performing engineering teams, I am thrilled to apply for the Vice President of Technology position at Greenbox Capital. Your focus on FinTech innovation in the Baltimore area, combined with the opportunity to partner directly with the CEO in driving technology vision, perfectly aligns with my proven executive leadership and local presence.

## Perfect Geographic and Executive Alignment

**Baltimore Area Excellence:** Currently residing in Baltimore, MD, I offer the exact geographic match Greenbox Capital seeks, with established remote work practices and availability for the 10% travel requirement. This local presence, combined with my executive technology experience, provides immediate value without relocation or transition concerns.

**Fractional CTO Experience:** Through Out-of-Band Development, LLC, I currently provide fractional CTO services, partnering with CEOs to develop technology strategy, manage budgets, and drive digital transformation. My previous full CTO role at Itrica, where I was promoted based on merit, demonstrated my ability to balance technical excellence with business leadership while managing P&L responsibilities.

## Proven Technology Leadership at Scale

**Team Building Excellence:** As Centers of Excellence Lead at Eliassen Group, I influenced 125+ developers across 10-15 teams, establishing enterprise-wide technology standards and best practices. This experience directly translates to building and scaling high-performing engineering teams while maintaining innovation velocity and technical excellence.

**Azure Platform Mastery:** My deep Azure expertise includes achieving 77% cost reductions ($13,800+ annual savings) while improving system performance and reliability. I bring comprehensive knowledge of Azure data technologies, cloud optimization strategies, and enterprise-scale platform development essential for Greenbox Capital's technology infrastructure.

## FinTech Experience and Product Excellence

**Financial Services Background:** Throughout my career, I've developed enterprise financial systems, payment processing platforms, and regulatory compliance solutions. From FDA-compliant systems for Big Pharma to clinical trial financial management, I understand the rigor and precision required in financial technology.

**Product Delivery Leadership:** My track record includes delivering complex platforms serving hundreds of thousands of users, with rapid execution capabilities demonstrated by delivering working solutions in one week after previous teams failed for 12 months. This combination of speed and quality ensures Greenbox Capital can innovate while maintaining stability.

## Strategic CEO Partnership

**Executive Collaboration:** Having reported directly to CEOs and boards, I excel at translating business vision into technology strategy. My approach emphasizes data-driven decision making, clear communication of technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and alignment of technology investments with business objectives.

**Budget and Investment Management:** Experience managing technology budgets, evaluating vendor relationships, and making build vs. buy decisions ensures efficient resource utilization. My vendor-neutral approach prevents costly mistakes while identifying opportunities for strategic technology investments.

## Technology Strategy and Innovation

**Digital Transformation Leadership:** I've led numerous enterprise digital transformation initiatives, modernizing legacy systems while maintaining business continuity. My strategic approach balances innovation with pragmatic execution, ensuring technology advances business goals without unnecessary risk.

**Emerging Technology Adoption:** From pioneering AI/ML implementations before mainstream adoption to creating industry-first solutions, I bring a proven ability to identify and leverage emerging technologies for competitive advantage while avoiding hype-driven mistakes.

## Immediate Value Creation for Greenbox Capital

While compensation details weren't specified, I'm confident that my extensive executive experience and proven results justify competitive VP-level compensation. My ability to immediately contribute to:

- **Technology Strategy:** Comprehensive vision aligned with business objectives
- **Team Development:** Building and scaling high-performing engineering organizations
