Dear Minted Leadership Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer (AI + Growth) position at Minted. Your mission to connect customers with the world's best artists while building innovative AI-driven experiences represents exactly the type of meaningful technology work that drives my passion for software engineering. With 20+ years of full-stack development experience and deep expertise in AI/ML systems, RAG implementation, and rapid prototyping, I'm energized by the opportunity to contribute to Minted's evolution as a design marketplace while pushing the boundaries of AI-driven creativity.

## Why Minted AI + Growth Represents an Exceptional Opportunity

**Creative Technology Innovation:** Your focus on leveraging AI to "develop and ship innovative experiences across all product surfaces" while supporting independent artists aligns perfectly with my belief that technology should amplify human creativity rather than replace it. The opportunity to build AI systems that help discover and showcase artistic talent represents exactly the type of meaningful innovation that motivates my best engineering work.

**Technical Challenge & AI Expertise:** Minted's need for "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large-scale data extraction" to enhance customer experiences directly matches my expertise in building production AI systems. Having architected comprehensive AI/ML platforms with RAG implementation achieving 40% improvement in content discovery, I understand both the technical complexity and user experience considerations essential for AI-powered creative platforms.

**Rapid Development & 0-to-1 Innovation:** Your emphasis on "rapidly prototype, test, and ship features" using a "small, fast-moving 0-to-1 team" aligns perfectly with my experience in rapid development environments. My track record reducing feature development cycles by 60% using AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor, combined with my ability to own features end-to-end from ideation to production, matches the autonomous and outcome-oriented culture you're building.

## Specific Value I Bring to Minted's AI + Growth Engineering

**AI-Assisted Development Excellence:** My extensive experience with "AI-assisted coding tools (e.g., Cursor)" includes advanced usage for code generation, refactoring, and debugging, enabling rapid development velocity while maintaining high code quality. Having established development processes that leverage AI tools to accelerate innovation, I can immediately contribute to Minted's fast-paced development environment and 6-month contract timeline.

**Full-Stack AI Integration:** Your requirement to "contribute across the stack, from front-end to back-end" leverages my 20+ years of full-stack development experience. I've built end-to-end AI-powered features including React frontends with intelligent user interfaces, Python backend services with LLM integration, and comprehensive data processing pipelines - exactly the technical versatility needed for AI-driven product development.

**RAG & Data Extraction Expertise:** My deep experience with "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large-scale data extraction" includes building production systems processing millions of documents with 95% accuracy. For Minted's creative platform, this translates to AI systems that can intelligently understand artistic styles, match customer preferences with artist capabilities, and enhance content discovery across your marketplace.

**Growth Engineering & User Experience:** Having implemented comprehensive A/B testing frameworks resulting in 25% improvement in user conversion rates, I understand how to build AI features that directly impact business metrics while enhancing user experiences. My approach focuses on measurable outcomes and data-driven optimization of AI-powered features.

## Understanding Minted's AI + Growth Challenges

**Creative AI Applications:** The opportunity to "design and implement features leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)" for artistic content presents unique technical challenges requiring sophisticated understanding of both AI capabilities and creative workflows. My experience building AI systems that enhance rather than replace human expertise aligns with the sensitive balance needed for supporting independent artists.

**Scalable AI Infrastructure:** Your need to "extend core APIs, AI infrastructure, and data pipelines" matches my expertise in building production-ready AI systems that scale with business growth. Having architected AI/ML platforms supporting millions of users with real-time processing capabilities, I understand the infrastructure requirements for AI-powered creative platforms.

**End-to-End Feature Ownership:** Your emphasis on owning "end-to-end feature development: from ideation and design to implementation, production, and user feedback" matches my approach to software engineering. I excel at thinking holistically about AI features, considering user experience, technical performance, business impact, and operational requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

## Cultural Alignment & Startup Excellence

**Passion for Building & Ownership:** Minted's value of "passion for building great products with passionate colleagues" and being "motivated by owning outcomes, not just inputs" resonates strongly with my professional approach. My 22,433 Stack Overflow reputation and 650K+ open source downloads demonstrate the knowledge-sharing and outcome-focused mindset that drives engineering excellence.

**Curiosity & AI Innovation:** As an "early tinkerer with AI technologies" who has been working with LLMs since early releases, I bring both technical depth and genuine enthusiasm for AI innovation. My experience establishing AI development practices and mentoring teams in AI/ML implementation positions me to contribute immediately while helping shape Minted's AI engineering culture.

**Autonomy & Entrepreneurial Mindset:** Having served as CTO and led 0-to-1 product development across multiple startups, I thrive in autonomous environments that require self-direction, rapid learning, and entrepreneurial problem-solving. My experience scaling engineering organizations aligns with the growth mindset and accountability Minted values.

## Technical Innovation & AI Leadership

**Show, Don't Tell:** I've built production AI systems that demonstrate rather than just discuss AI capabilities - from RAG implementations improving content discovery by 40% to LLM-powered document processing achieving 95% accuracy. I can share specific examples of AI applications I've architected that showcase innovative approaches to complex technical challenges.

**Emerging Technology Adoption:** My track record includes early adoption and successful implementation of emerging AI technologies, from early GPT integrations to advanced prompt engineering and fine-tuning approaches. I stay engaged with the latest AI research while maintaining focus on practical applications that deliver measurable business value.

## Strategic Career Positioning

This 6-month contract represents an ideal opportunity to contribute meaningfully to Minted's AI innovation while working alongside a "repeat founder and small, collaborative team" in a creative technology environment. The combination of AI technical challenges, rapid development pace, and meaningful impact on independent artists aligns perfectly with my career goals and passion for technology that enhances human creativity.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my AI engineering expertise, full-stack development experience, and rapid prototyping capabilities can contribute to Minted's AI + Growth initiatives. I'm particularly interested in learning more about your current AI experiments, the specific challenges you're solving for artists and customers, and how the AI + Growth team will contribute to Minted's continued innovation in the creative marketplace.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the possibility of joining Minted's mission to amplify independent artistry through innovative AI-driven experiences while contributing to the technical excellence that will drive your continued success.

Best regards,
