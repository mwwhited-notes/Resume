# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**Nymbus Solutions Architect**

I'm a Senior Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of enterprise API development and financial services integration expertise, having architected RESTful API platforms serving hundreds of thousands of users while achieving 77% infrastructure cost optimization through cloud migration and event-driven architecture implementation. My background includes extensive experience in GraphQL, OAuth security, workflow orchestration, and banking technology integration that aligns perfectly with Nymbus's API-first approach to FinTech innovation, combined with proven track record in remote collaboration and technical documentation excellence. I'm particularly excited about Nymbus's 100% remote culture and mission to transform community banking through modern API platforms, seeing a perfect opportunity to apply my deep API architecture expertise, multi-cloud experience, and financial services domain knowledge to accelerate digital transformation for financial institutions. While I recognize the compensation consideration, the combination of cutting-edge FinTech innovation, complete remote flexibility, comprehensive benefits with equity participation, and the opportunity to revolutionize banking technology creates compelling total value that makes this an exceptional career opportunity worth pursuing.
