# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**Publix Super Markets Solution Architect - IT Modernization (Remote)**

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of Microsoft .NET and Azure expertise, having recently achieved 77% Azure cost reduction ($13,800+ annual savings) while architecting enterprise systems for large-scale distributed operations serving hundreds of thousands of users. My background includes comprehensive experience building cloud-native applications, containerized microservices, and AI-powered inventory optimization systems that directly align with Publix's $121+ million technology transformation and strategic focus on artificial intelligence and automation for retail operations. I'm particularly drawn to Publix's employee ownership model and "Family first" culture, seeing a perfect opportunity to apply my collaborative leadership experience (influencing 125+ developers) and crisis resolution expertise to support the largest employee-owned company's technology modernization while contributing to a mission that benefits 250,000+ employee-shareholders. My unique combination of perfect technology stack alignment (.NET/Azure), proven enterprise retail systems expertise, and employee-first leadership approach—demonstrated through 652K+ NuGet downloads, 22,433+ Stack Overflow reputation, and Fortune "100 Best Companies" culture alignment—positions me to accelerate Publix Technology's continued innovation in serving 1,400+ stores across eight states.
