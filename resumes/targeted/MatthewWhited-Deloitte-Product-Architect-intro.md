# Matthew Whited - Professional Introduction
## Product Architect Opportunity - Deloitte Technology Product Engineering

---

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of enterprise architecture experience, specializing in the exact technical stack Deloitte requires: C# .NET Core, Angular, React, NodeJS, Python, and SQL/NoSQL databases. My recent work implementing production AI/ML systems with AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers and custom database extensions aligns perfectly with Deloitte's 2025 agentic AI transformation strategy. I'm particularly drawn to Deloitte's Engineering-as-a-Service approach and the opportunity to apply my proven track record of substantial cost reduction and performance optimization to help clients transition from digital transformation to AI transformation. My unique combination of technical innovation—demonstrated through 650K+ package downloads and 22K+ Stack Overflow reputation—and strategic business impact positions me to drive meaningful results for Deloitte's Technology Product Engineering initiatives while serving as a technical advocate for high-visibility transformation projects.
