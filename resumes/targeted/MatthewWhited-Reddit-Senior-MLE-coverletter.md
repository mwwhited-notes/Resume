Dear Reddit Hiring Manager,

Reddit's mission to empower people to participate in global conversations through communities perfectly aligns with my passion for applying machine learning to personalization, discovery, and recommendation problems. Your Core Experience organization's focus on connecting users with relevant content and communities represents exactly the type of challenging ML problem I've been solving throughout my career, most recently through production implementations of transformer-based recommendation systems and custom algorithm development.

**Production ML Expertise Directly Matching Your Technical Requirements**

My hands-on experience implementing AllMiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformers in production systems demonstrates the industry-level deep learning capabilities essential for Reddit's personalization challenges. I've successfully designed and deployed comprehensive ML pipelines processing thousands of daily recommendations with sub-second response times—exactly the type of large-scale system performance Reddit's user base requires. With 4+ years of end-to-end model training, evaluation, and deployment experience, I've developed expertise in TensorFlow ecosystem optimization and custom algorithm implementations that achieve sub-linear similarity search performance. My track record includes 650K+ package downloads across ML frameworks, demonstrating proven ability to create production-ready solutions that gain widespread adoption.

**Technical Leadership and Cross-Functional Collaboration Excellence**

Providing technical direction to junior engineers has been central to my role leading Centers of Excellence across development teams. I excel at translating complex ML concepts into actionable guidance while maintaining collaborative relationships across product, design, and engineering organizations. My approach combines deep technical expertise with strategic thinking—demonstrated through achieving 4.8/5.0 performance ratings while contributing to technology strategy and framework development. I understand the entrepreneurial spirit essential for Reddit's innovation culture, having successfully led technical initiatives from concept through production deployment with measurable business impact.

**Personalization and Discovery System Alignment**

Your focus on personalization, discovery, and recommendation problems resonates strongly with my experience developing hybrid ML architectures that combine deep learning embeddings with traditional algorithms for optimal user experience. My work with semantic similarity matching and automated content discovery systems directly applies to Reddit's challenges of connecting users with relevant communities and conversations. I've implemented sophisticated recommendation engines that balance accuracy with performance, understanding the critical importance of both technical excellence and user satisfaction in community-driven platforms.

I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my production ML expertise to Reddit's unique community-centric approach while contributing to the technical strategy that empowers millions of users to discover and participate in meaningful conversations. My combination of advanced ML capabilities, proven technical leadership, and collaborative approach would enable immediate contribution to Reddit's Core Experience objectives.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my ML expertise and passion for recommendation systems can contribute to Reddit's continued innovation in community discovery and personalization.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Whited
