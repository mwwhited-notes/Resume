# Matthew Whited - Professional Introduction
## Engineering Manager, ML Understanding - Reddit

---

I'm an Engineering Manager with comprehensive ML leadership experience, having led AI/ML strategy development across 125+ developers while implementing production AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers for semantic content understanding in high-volume systems. My background coaching and developing technical teams through structured ML training programs—combined with proven cross-functional collaboration achieving 4.8/5.0 performance ratings—aligns perfectly with Reddit's need for strategic leadership in foundational AI model development. I'm particularly drawn to Reddit's ML Understanding mission of deeply comprehending content and communities, and the opportunity to apply my proven experience with transformer-based architectures, natural language processing, and content classification systems to advance Reddit's AI capabilities at scale. My unique combination of production ML expertise—validated through 650K+ framework downloads and extensive semantic similarity implementations—and strategic engineering leadership positions me to drive meaningful innovation for Reddit's ML Understanding team while fostering the technical growth needed for next-generation content understanding systems.
