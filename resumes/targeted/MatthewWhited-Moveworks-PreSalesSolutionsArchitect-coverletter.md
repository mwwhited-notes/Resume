Dear Moveworks Hiring Team,

## Opening

I'm excited to apply for the PreSales Solutions Architect position at Moveworks, where I can leverage my 20+ years of enterprise systems expertise and technical enablement experience to empower your presales team while helping enterprises transform their productivity through AI. Having successfully managed complex technical environments that enabled revenue teams across multiple organizations, I understand the critical importance of seamless demo environments and innovative technical tooling in demonstrating compelling AI value propositions to enterprise clients.

## Technical Excellence & Enterprise Systems Leadership

My experience directly aligns with Moveworks' technical requirements, having spent over a decade building and managing enterprise systems integrations including ServiceNow environments, identity management platforms, and complex automation solutions. At Eliassen Group, I led comprehensive technical enablement programs across 125+ developers, delivering training ranging from intimate developer sessions to large-scale boot campsâ€”exactly the type of cross-functional collaboration essential for empowering presales teams with deep technical knowledge.

My crisis resolution expertise demonstrates the rapid solution delivery capability Moveworks needs: when previous teams worked 12 months without results on an AI/ML project, I delivered a working prototype within one week using custom .NET services and advanced search architectures. This same ability to quickly prototype and test innovative solutions while optimizing enterprise costs (77% Azure reduction saving $13,800+ annually) directly translates to helping Moveworks showcase tangible value propositions that resonate with enterprise decision-makers.

## Strategic Value & AI Platform Innovation

What excites me most about Moveworks is the opportunity to contribute to the evolution of enterprise AI while supporting the teams that bring these transformative solutions to market. My background in enterprise architecture, combined with hands-on experience building custom automation platforms and integration frameworks, positions me to enhance Moveworks' technical infrastructure while ensuring your presales team can effectively demonstrate how AI transforms employee productivity across diverse enterprise environments.

Having worked with enterprise clients ranging from Big Pharma (Sanofi, AstraZeneca) to financial services (JPMorgan Chase) and healthcare systems, I understand the nuanced requirements different industries bring to AI adoption. This enterprise perspective, combined with my vendor-neutral advisory approach and proven ability to translate complex technical concepts for diverse audiences, makes me uniquely positioned to help Moveworks' presales team navigate the technical complexities of enterprise AI implementations while building compelling demonstrations that drive revenue growth.

## Closing

I'm eager to bring my enterprise systems expertise, technical enablement experience, and passion for innovative AI solutions to Moveworks' presales team. The opportunity to prototype cutting-edge solutions while empowering others to showcase transformative AI technology aligns perfectly with my technical background and commitment to enabling organizational success through technology excellence.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience managing complex technical environments, delivering rapid solutions, and enabling development teams can contribute to Moveworks' continued success in revolutionizing enterprise productivity through AI.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Whited
