I'm a Principal AI Software Engineer with 20+ years of full-stack development experience, having recently deployed AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers in production systems while building comprehensive AI applications using Python, TypeScript, and React for enterprise-scale platforms. My background collaborating across product, design, and customer experience teams—combined with proven mentorship of 125+ engineers and 4.8/5.0 performance ratings—aligns perfectly with Gusto's need for strategic AI leadership in developing seamless, connected HR experiences. I'm particularly drawn to Gusto's customer-centric approach to AI innovation, exemplified by Gus the AI assistant, and the opportunity to apply my expertise in scalable distributed systems and AI-powered automation to enhance small business productivity. My unique combination of production AI expertise—validated through 650K+ framework downloads and extensive enterprise application development—and service-minded innovation philosophy positions me to drive meaningful impact for Gusto's Unified Service Platform while contributing to the next generation of intelligent HR solutions.
