# Matthew Whited - Professional Introduction
## Senior Machine Learning Engineer - Reddit Core Experience

---

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of end-to-end ML pipeline experience, having recently deployed AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers in production recommendation systems processing thousands of daily transactions with exceptional performance ratings. My expertise in personalization and discovery systems—demonstrated through custom algorithm development achieving sub-linear search performance and hybrid ML architectures—aligns perfectly with Reddit's Core Experience mission of connecting users with relevant communities and conversations. I'm particularly drawn to Reddit's innovative approach to community-driven content discovery and the opportunity to apply my proven technical direction capabilities and cross-functional collaboration experience to enhance user personalization at scale. My unique combination of production ML expertise—validated through 650K+ framework downloads and 22K+ Stack Overflow reputation—and strategic technical vision positions me to drive meaningful improvements in Reddit's recommendation and discovery systems while contributing to the entrepreneurial culture that empowers global conversations.
