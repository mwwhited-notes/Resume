# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**Microsoft Principal AI/ML Architect (M365)**

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of AI/ML engineering experience, having recently achieved 652K+ NuGet downloads through pure .NET AI implementations that eliminate Python dependencies while delivering enterprise-scale capabilities. My background includes Centers of Excellence leadership across 125+ developers while building production-grade AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers and custom vector database extensions that directly align with Microsoft's Copilot and M365 AI strategy. I'm particularly drawn to Microsoft's vision of AI-powered productivity transformation and see a perfect opportunity to apply my deep Microsoft ecosystem expertise—including C# Gold Badge mastery and 22K+ Stack Overflow reputation—to advance M365's intelligent collaboration capabilities. My unique combination of Microsoft community authority and proven business impact through advanced AI architecture positions me to drive meaningful results for Microsoft's M365 AI innovation goals.
