## LinkedIn Introduction Message

Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Matthew Whited, a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of presales engineering excellence and cloud architecture leadership. I'm very interested in SHI International's Sr. Solutions Architect - Services Presales - Google Cloud position and would love to connect.

What draws me to SHI is your mission as a "technology concierge" - it perfectly aligns with my role as "the trusted advisor" companies call for complex cloud migrations and technical crisis resolution. I've spent my career helping organizations avoid costly mistakes while delivering quantifiable results (like achieving 77% Azure cost reductions).

My presales engineering background includes:
• Leading technical demonstrations and proof-of-concepts that secured enterprise contracts
• Delivering 25+ comprehensive client training programs
• Crisis resolution - delivering solutions in weeks when others failed for months
• RFP responses and solution architecture for multi-million dollar opportunities

I'm committed to obtaining Google Certified Architect - Professional certification within 90 days and believe my vendor-neutral approach and multi-cloud expertise would bring immediate value to SHI's Google Cloud practice.

Would you be available for a brief conversation about this opportunity? I'd love to learn more about SHI's Google Cloud growth strategy and how my experience might contribute to your team's success.

Best regards,  
Matthew Whited
