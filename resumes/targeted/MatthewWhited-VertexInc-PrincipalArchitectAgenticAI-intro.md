# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**Vertex Inc. Principal Architect, Agentic AI**

I'm a Principal AI Architect with 20+ years of enterprise intelligent system leadership and pioneering AI/ML implementation before mainstream adoption, having recently delivered production AI solutions in one week after previous teams struggled for 12 months while achieving 77% Azure cost optimization through intelligent automation and performance engineering. My background includes comprehensive experience building cross-cloud AI agent collaboration protocols, semantic intelligence systems, and regulatory compliance automation that directly enables powerful automation and continuous compliance for complex enterprise workflows. I'm particularly drawn to Vertex's mission to transform indirect tax compliance through AI and the API-ready platform connecting structured tax data across business ecosystems, seeing a perfect opportunity to apply my proven track record in multi-cloud AI architecture, regulatory technology innovation, and enterprise-scale intelligent system development to revolutionize how global enterprises manage complex tax determination and compliance automation. My unique combination of Agentic AI expertise, Azure AI and AWS multi-cloud mastery, and regulatory intelligence experience—demonstrated through 652K+ NuGet downloads, 22,433+ Stack Overflow reputation, and crisis resolution capabilities—positions me to accelerate Vertex's AI transformation while building the semantic intelligence and cross-cloud agent orchestration systems that will define the future of tax compliance technology.
