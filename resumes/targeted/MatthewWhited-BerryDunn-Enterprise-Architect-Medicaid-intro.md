# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**BerryDunn Enterprise Architect – Medicaid Consulting**

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of healthcare enterprise architecture experience, having recently architected production AI/ML systems processing millions of insurance and medical records while ensuring strict regulatory compliance at ERisk Services. My background includes leading Centers of Excellence across 125+ developers and successfully preventing costly technology mistakes through strategic evaluation—exactly the risk management expertise essential for high-visibility government healthcare projects. I'm particularly drawn to BerryDunn's mission of helping state agencies modernize Medicaid systems and see a perfect opportunity to apply my deep experience with healthcare data architecture, legacy system integration, and regulatory compliance to drive successful MES transformations. My unique combination of technical innovation and proven client success—demonstrated through 652K+ NuGet downloads and substantial infrastructure cost optimizations—positions me to deliver meaningful results for BerryDunn's Medicaid Practice Group and the state agencies they serve.
