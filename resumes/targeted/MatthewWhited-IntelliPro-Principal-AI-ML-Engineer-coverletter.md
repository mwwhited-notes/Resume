**Principal AI/ML Engineer Search**  

Dear Hiring Team,

The opportunity to join IntelliPro Group as Principal AI/ML Engineer represents the perfect convergence of my two decades architecting enterprise AI/ML platforms with your company's rapid global expansion and commitment to becoming the fastest growing IT services leader in Americas & APAC. Having scaled AI/ML infrastructure across international teams while delivering measurable business impact, I'm excited to drive technical strategy and innovation for your AI/ML platforms as you continue expanding across USA, China, Canada, Singapore, Philippines, UK, India, Netherlands, and Germany.

## Technical Leadership Aligned with Global AI/ML Growth

My experience architecting scalable AI/ML platforms directly addresses IntelliPro's infrastructure needs. At ERisk Services, I deployed production-grade AllMiniLM-L6-v2 transformers with 384-dimensional embeddings, achieving sub-linear search performance through custom LSH algorithms—exactly the kind of real-time AI/ML systems that power global enterprise operations. More significantly, I extended SQL Server with custom SQLCLR vector implementations, demonstrating the database innovation and performance optimization capabilities essential for AI/ML platforms serving multiple countries and diverse technology ecosystems.

The comprehensive multi-layered system I architected—featuring 5 API endpoints, multi-database architecture, and enterprise-grade security—mirrors the scalable, reliable infrastructure IntelliPro needs to support clients from start-ups to global brands. My achievement of 4.8/5.0 performance ratings while delivering 84 completed AI/ML work items under aggressive timelines proves the rapid innovation delivery capability crucial for your fast-growing global operations.

## Strategic Innovation for International Technology Leadership

IntelliPro's focus on driving technical strategy and innovation across AI/ML infrastructure aligns perfectly with my Centers of Excellence leadership, where I influenced 125+ developers across international teams while preventing costly technology adoption mistakes. This experience translates directly to leading AI/ML platform development across your global operations, ensuring technical excellence while avoiding the pitfalls that plague rapidly scaling international technology organizations.

My successful creation of enterprise frameworks that remain foundational years after implementation—combined with substantial cloud infrastructure cost reductions while improving performance—demonstrates the strategic technology leadership and business impact essential for IntelliPro's continued growth. The hybrid AI/ML search architecture I developed, combining vector embeddings with traditional search for superior performance and cost efficiency, exemplifies the innovative thinking needed to maintain competitive advantage in your rapidly expanding markets.

## Equity Partnership and Long-Term Strategic Impact

What excites me most about IntelliPro's Principal AI/ML Engineer role is the equity participation opportunity, reflecting a true partnership approach to driving long-term business success. My track record of creating lasting technological change—evidenced by frameworks still powering organizational development years later—aligns with the kind of strategic impact that creates substantial equity value. Having successfully led crisis resolution with 100% success rates while building scalable platforms, I bring the reliability and innovation needed to protect and accelerate your equity growth.

I'm eager to discuss how my proven ability to architect enterprise AI/ML platforms, lead global technology teams, and deliver measurable business impact can accelerate IntelliPro's mission to provide unmatched talent solutions across your expanding global footprint. Thank you for considering my application for this exciting opportunity to join your leadership team.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Whited
