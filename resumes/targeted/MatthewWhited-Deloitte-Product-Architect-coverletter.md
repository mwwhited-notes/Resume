I've successfully prevented costly technology adoption mistakes through comprehensive evaluation processes—saving organizations substantial implementation costs while steering them toward proven alternatives. This technology pragmatism aligns perfectly with Deloitte's strategic approach of balancing innovation with practical business value. My track record of substantial cost reduction through architecture optimization and my experience resolving critical enterprise challenges demonstrates the business-focused technical advocacy that your Product Architect role demands.
