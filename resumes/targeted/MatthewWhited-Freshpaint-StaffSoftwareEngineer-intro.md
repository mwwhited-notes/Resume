# Quick Introduction - Freshpaint Staff Software Engineer

I'm a Staff Software Engineer with 20+ years of healthcare privacy infrastructure experience, having built FDA-compliant systems for Big Pharma partnerships (Sanofi, AstraZeneca, GSK) and Harvard Medical that directly translate to HIPAA-compliant customer data platforms. My database performance innovations—including custom SQLCLR vector extensions processing millions of healthcare records—demonstrate the privacy-first architecture expertise Freshpaint's healthcare customers require. I'm particularly drawn to Freshpaint's mission of enabling healthcare marketing optimization while maintaining strict privacy governance, as it aligns perfectly with my pattern of rapid crisis resolution (1-week delivery after others failed for months) and proven remote leadership success across distributed healthcare teams. My unique combination of healthcare regulatory expertise and database performance innovation—demonstrated through 652K+ NuGet downloads and 77% infrastructure cost optimizations—positions me to accelerate Freshpaint's privacy-first customer data infrastructure that enables healthcare companies to understand and market to their audiences while protecting patient data.
