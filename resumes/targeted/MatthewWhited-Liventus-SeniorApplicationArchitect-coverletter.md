**Comprehensive Framework Development:** I've created enterprise .NET frameworks that remain foundational years after implementation, demonstrating my ability to build scalable, maintainable architectures. My experience includes complex event processing, dynamic expression engines, and performance optimization techniques that dramatically improve application scalability.

**Agile Team Leadership:** Having transformed multiple development teams to agile methodologies, I understand the balance between rapid delivery and code quality. My approach includes comprehensive code review processes, automated testing strategies, and continuous integration pipelines that ensure consistent delivery excellence.

## Location Flexibility and Commitment
