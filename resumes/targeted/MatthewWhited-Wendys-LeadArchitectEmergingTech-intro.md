# Quick Introduction - Matthew Whited
**The Wendy's Company Lead Architect - Emerging Technology & Product**

I'm a Senior Principal Solutions Architect with 20+ years of platform stabilization and AI/ML implementation expertise, having rescued multiple failing technology initiatives by delivering working AI solutions in one week that replaced 12-month unsuccessful efforts while achieving 77% infrastructure cost optimization through strategic architecture redesign. My background includes extensive experience in cross-vendor management, real-time data processing, IoT integration, and production AI/ML systems that directly address the FreshAI platform's stabilization needs and Wendy's broader emerging technology roadmap. I'm particularly excited about Wendy's pioneering position as the first QSR to implement enterprise-scale AI for operational optimization, seeing a perfect opportunity to apply my crisis resolution expertise, proven platform stabilization skills, and innovation leadership to transform the FreshAI platform from pilot to enterprise-wide deployment across 7,000+ locations. My unique combination of immediate tactical intervention capabilities and strategic architecture vision positions me to deliver rapid platform stabilization while building the scalable foundation needed for voice AI, predictive maintenance, and personalization engines that will define the future of restaurant technology at Fortune 500 scale.
