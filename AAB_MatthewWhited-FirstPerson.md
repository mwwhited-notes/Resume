# Hello, I'm Matthew Whited

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with a passion for solving complex technical challenges and building systems that make a real difference. With over 20 years in software development, I've had the privilege of working across everything from embedded microcontrollers to enterprise-scale AI systems.

## What Drives Me

I love the intersection of hardware and software - there's something deeply satisfying about understanding systems from the silicon up to the cloud. My background in electronics gives me a unique perspective on performance optimization and low-level system design that I bring to every project.

## My Journey

My career started with electronics and embedded systems, which taught me to think about efficiency and resource constraints. This foundation has been invaluable as I've moved into enterprise architecture, where those same principles apply at scale. Whether I'm designing a custom microprocessor or optimizing database queries for million-record datasets, it's all about understanding the fundamentals.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm deep into AI and machine learning integration, particularly around semantic search and vector databases. I've built custom SQLCLR extensions for SQL Server that have been downloaded over 623,000 times across my 20 NuGet packages - it's incredibly rewarding to see the community adopting these tools. My command-line tools alone have over 34,000 downloads each, and I've developed specialized libraries for everything from electronic scoring systems in fencing to radiation monitoring devices. My vector search extensions are being used in production systems, and I'm working with sentence transformers for fuzzy matching. It's fascinating how we can now make computers understand meaning, not just match text.

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Building for the long term** - Creating frameworks and patterns that teams can build on
- **Teaching while doing** - I've run .NET boot camps and AI training programs because knowledge sharing is crucial
- **Getting my hands dirty** - Whether it's developing USB HID device abstractions or debugging embedded firmware, I'm not afraid to dive deep
- **Solving niche problems** - From electronic scoring systems to radiation monitoring, I enjoy tackling specialized technical challenges
- **Continuous learning** - Technology evolves rapidly, and staying curious is essential

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding, I'm often working on personal electronics projects - I've designed my own 16-bit microprocessor and built custom 3D printer firmware. My EmbeddedBakery repository has over 194 commits spanning Verilog, VHDL, and C/C++ projects. I also enjoy photography and have been experimenting with AI-powered image analysis and cataloging systems.

I'm active in the developer community with 22,000+ reputation on Stack Overflow from 16+ years of helping fellow developers. I've been recognized as a GitHub Arctic Code Vault Contributor, which feels like a small part of preserving digital history.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow technologists and discuss everything from FPGA design to the latest developments in transformer models.
