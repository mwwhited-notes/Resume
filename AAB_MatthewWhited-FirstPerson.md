# Hello, I'm Matthew Whited

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with a passion for solving complex technical challenges and building systems that make a real difference. With over 20 years in software development, I've had the privilege of working across everything from embedded microcontrollers to enterprise-scale AI systems.

## What Drives Me

I love the intersection of hardware and software - there's something deeply satisfying about understanding systems from the silicon up to the cloud. My background in electronics gives me a unique perspective on performance optimization and low-level system design that I bring to every project.

## My Journey

My career started with electronics and embedded systems, which taught me to think about efficiency and resource constraints. This foundation has been invaluable as I've moved into enterprise architecture, where those same principles apply at scale. Whether I'm designing a custom microprocessor or optimizing database queries for million-record datasets, it's all about understanding the fundamentals.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm deep into AI and machine learning integration, particularly around semantic search and vector databases. I've been building custom extensions for SQL Server to support vector operations and working with sentence transformers for fuzzy matching. It's fascinating how we can now make computers understand meaning, not just match text.

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Building for the long term** - Creating frameworks and patterns that teams can build on
- **Teaching while doing** - I've run .NET boot camps and AI training programs because knowledge sharing is crucial
- **Getting my hands dirty** - Whether it's reverse engineering protocols or debugging embedded firmware, I'm not afraid to dive deep
- **Continuous learning** - Technology evolves rapidly, and staying curious is essential

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding, I'm often working on personal electronics projects - I've designed my own 16-bit microprocessor and built custom 3D printer firmware. I also enjoy photography and have been experimenting with AI-powered image analysis and cataloging systems.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow technologists and discuss everything from FPGA design to the latest developments in transformer models.
