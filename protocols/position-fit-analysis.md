# Position Fit Analysis Protocol

## Purpose
Analyze individual job postings provided by URL to determine fit quality and automatically create targeted application materials for positions meeting threshold criteria.

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Position Data Extraction and Exclusion Verification
1. **URL Fetch and Analysis**
   - Use WebFetch to retrieve job posting content from provided URL
   - **CRITICAL:** Verify position is still open/active - if closed or expired, immediately report status and stop analysis
   - Extract key position details: company name, job title, location, compensation
   - Identify technical requirements, experience levels, and key responsibilities
   - Note application process details and timeline requirements

2. **MANDATORY EXCLUSION VERIFICATION**
   - **CRITICAL:** Check company against `./SearchResults/excluded-companies.md` BEFORE proceeding with analysis
   - **INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION:** Identify primary industry (fintech, blockchain, cannabis, marketing/advertising, government contractor)
   - **If company is excluded:** Immediately stop analysis and report: "This company is on the exclusion list due to [specific reason: industry/investor association/company exclusion]. Analysis cannot proceed."
   - **Verify investor associations:** Check for connections to Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, or Marc Andreessen
   - **Verify company exclusions:** Check for Microsoft, Salesforce, Big Tech (Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix, Oracle)
   - **Only proceed if company is approved:** Continue with company intelligence phase

2. **Company Intelligence**
   - **EXECUTE COMPANY RESEARCH PROTOCOL:** Use `read protocols/company-research.md and follow the protocol step-by-step`
