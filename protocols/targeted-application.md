# Targeted Job Application Protocol
**Purpose:** Complete job search to targeted resume and cover letter generation
**Output:** Ready-to-submit application materials for highest-probability opportunities

---

## Protocol Overview

This protocol combines comprehensive job search with immediate application material generation, creating targeted resumes and cover letters for the best-matching positions with highest acceptance probability. Each opportunity receives customized materials optimized for that specific role and company.

## When to Execute This Protocol

Execute when user requests:
- "do a targeted job search"
- "find jobs and create applications for them"
- "create targeted resumes and cover letters"
- Any variation requesting job search with application materials

## Protocol Steps

### Phase 1: Job Search Execution (TodoWrite Required)

Create todo list with these initial tasks:
1. Execute comprehensive job search per protocols/job-search.md
2. Analyze and rank opportunities by match probability
3. Select top 5-8 highest probability positions
4. **Execute comprehensive company research per protocols/company-research.md for each selected position**
5. Create targeted application materials for each selected position using company research insights
6. Store all materials in ./SearchResults/targeted/ directory

#### Step 1.1: Execute Job Search Protocol
```bash
# Follow existing job search protocol
read protocols/job-search.md and execute all steps
```
- **EXCLUSION LIST VERIFICATION FIRST:** Review `./SearchResults/excluded-companies.md` and exclude all companies associated with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, or Marc Andreessen
- **Check Application History:** Review `./SearchResults/applied-to.md` and `./SearchResults/apply-next.md` to avoid duplicates
- **Already Applied Check:** If position found in either tracking file, respond with "Already applied to [Company] - [Position] on [Date]" and skip this position
- **Excluded Company Check:** If company found in exclusion list, respond with "Skipping [Company] - on exclusion list due to [investor association]" and skip this position
- Use all existing job search methodology
- Apply user preferences (remote priority, $180K+/$85+hr, no clearance)
- Focus on positions with direct application links
- Filter out companies applied to within last 6 months
- Document results in SearchResults/Jobs/ directory

#### Step 1.2: Probability Assessment Matrix
For each position found, evaluate:

**Technical Match (1-10):**
- AI/ML requirements alignment
- .NET/C# technology stack match
- Enterprise architecture needs
- Framework development relevance

**Experience Match (1-10):**
- Required years of experience
- Leadership/management requirements
- Industry experience alignment
- Specific skill requirements

**Culture/Company Match (1-10):**
- Company size preference alignment
- Remote work culture
- Technology innovation focus
- Growth stage compatibility

**Application Accessibility (1-10):**
- Direct application process available
- Clear job requirements posted
- Reasonable application process
- Active recruiting indicators

### Phase 2: Position Selection and Prioritization

#### Step 2.1: Calculate Composite Scores
For each position: `(Technical Match + Experience Match + Culture Match + Application Accessibility) / 4`

#### Step 2.2: Select Top Candidates
- **Primary Selection:** Top 5 positions with composite score ≥ 8.0
- **Secondary Selection:** Next 3 positions with composite score ≥ 7.0 (if needed)
- **Maximum:** No more than 8 positions per execution to maintain quality

#### Step 2.3: Final Validation
Ensure selected positions meet all criteria:
- ✅ Remote work available
- ✅ Compensation ≥ $180K/$85hr
- ✅ No security clearance required
- ✅ Direct application process available
- ✅ Job posting is current (within 30 days)
- ✅ **Not Previously Applied:** Verify against both applied-to.md and apply-next.md (no application within 6 months)
- ✅ **Commute Analysis:** For on-site/hybrid positions in Baltimore metro, verify company address and calculate commute time from 1221 N Calvert St, Baltimore, MD 21202

### Phase 3: Company Research Execution

2. **Use Application Tracking Protocol:** Follow `protocols/application-tracking.md` for each application
3. **Document Application Method:** Note "Targeted Application Protocol" as source

#### Step 7.2: Create Application Strategy Document
**File:** `./SearchResults/targeted/Application_Strategy_[YYYYMMDD].md`

```markdown
# Targeted Application Strategy - [Date]

## Selected Positions Summary
| Company | Position | Match Score | Compensation | Application Link |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| [Company] | [Role] | [Score] | [Salary] | [URL] |

```

### Phase 8: Rejection Handling Protocol

#### Step 8.1: Process Rejection Notifications
**When receiving rejection emails or notifications:**

1. **Check Existing Status First:**
   ```bash
   # Search for the company and position in closed archive
   grep -i "company_name.*position_title" ./SearchResults/closed-archive.md
   ```

2. **Duplicate Rejection Handling:**
   - **If Already Rejected:** Ignore the duplicate rejection notification completely - no action needed
   - **If Status is "Withdrawn":** Update to "Rejected" with current date
   - **If Not Found:** Check applied-to.md and move to closed-archive.md with rejection status

3. **No Action Required for Duplicates:**
   - Companies often send multiple rejection emails (automated systems, recruiter follow-ups)
