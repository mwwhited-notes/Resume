# Job Search Protocol - Comprehensive Market Analysis

## Purpose
This protocol provides a systematic approach to conducting comprehensive job searches across multiple platforms, targeting Principal Solutions Architect, CTO, and senior technology leadership roles.

#### Add Jobs to Apply-Next.md Process
For each verified active opportunity with fit score ≥7.0/10:

1. **Update Apply-Next.md Entry:**
   ```markdown
   | # | URL | Company | Position | Match Score | Status | Application Materials | Notes |
   |---|-----|---------|----------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
   | X | [job-url](verified-active-url) | Company Name | Position Title | X.X/10 | 🔍 Possible Match | - | Platform: [source], Salary: [range], Verified: [date] |
   ```

2. **Status Classification for Apply-Next.md:**
   - **🔍 Possible Match:** Initial discovery, fit score 7.0-7.9/10
   - **⭐ High Priority:** Strong match, fit score 8.0-8.9/10  
   - **🎯 Top Target:** Exceptional match, fit score 9.0+/10
   - **❌ No Match:** Below threshold or disqualifying factors

3. **Required Information per Entry:**
   - Verified active job URL (tested with WebFetch)
   - Company name and position title
   - Calculated fit score (1-10 scale)
   - Source platform (LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, etc.)
   - Salary range if available
   - URL verification date
   - Key qualifying/disqualifying factors

### Step 7: Automatic Targeted Application Trigger
**CRITICAL WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:** For opportunities with fit score ≥8.5/10, automatically trigger targeted application protocol.

#### Targeted Application Auto-Execution
When jobs are added to apply-next.md with status "⭐ High Priority" or "🎯 Top Target":

1. **Execute Targeted Application Protocol:** 
   ```
   read protocols/targeted-application.md and execute all steps
   ```

2. **Focus on Top Opportunities:**
   - Prioritize fit scores 9.0+/10 for immediate execution
   - Process fit scores 8.5-8.9/10 within 48 hours
   - Consider fit scores 8.0-8.4/10 for weekly batch processing

3. **Application Material Creation:**
   - Generate targeted resume for each high-priority opportunity
   - Create customized cover letter highlighting relevant experience
   - Develop company-specific introduction/outreach message
   - Store all materials in `./resumes/targeted/` directory

4. **Update Apply-Next.md Status:**
   ```markdown
   | Status | Application Materials | Notes |
   |--------|---------------------|-------|
   | ✅ READY TO APPLY | [Resume](./resumes/targeted/...) \| [Cover Letter](./resumes/targeted/...) \| [Intro](./resumes/targeted/...) | Materials created [date] |
   ```

### Step 8: Application Tracking Integration
**SEAMLESS WORKFLOW:** Connect job search → apply-next.md → targeted applications → applied-to.md

#### Complete Application Workflow
1. **Job Discovery:** Job search protocol identifies opportunities
2. **Opportunity Evaluation:** Add to apply-next.md with fit scores
3. **Material Creation:** Generate targeted applications for high-priority matches
4. **Application Submission:** Submit applications using created materials
5. **Application Tracking:** Move to applied-to.md with submission date and status

#### Cross-Reference Requirements
- **Avoid Duplicates:** Check applied-to.md before adding to apply-next.md
- **Reapplication Logic:** Note companies applied to >6 months ago as potential reapplication candidates
- **Status Synchronization:** Keep apply-next.md and applied-to.md synchronized

### Step 9: Rejection Notification Handling
**EFFICIENCY PROTOCOL:** Handle rejection notifications without unnecessary file updates

#### Rejection Processing Workflow
1. **Initial Status Check:**
   ```bash
   # Search closed archive for company and position
   grep -i "company_name.*position_title" ./SearchResults/closed-archive.md
   ```

2. **Action Decision Tree:**
   - **Already Rejected → NO ACTION:** If position shows "Rejected" status, ignore duplicate notification
   - **Status is "Withdrawn" → UPDATE:** Change status from "Withdrawn" to "Rejected" with date
   - **Not in Archive → MOVE:** Check applied-to.md and move to closed-archive.md

3. **Duplicate Rejection Prevention:**
   - Companies send multiple rejection emails (automated + recruiter + system updates)
   - Only process first rejection notification
   - Subsequent rejections for same position require no action
   - Maintains clean tracking without redundant updates

#### Common Duplicate Scenarios
- **ATS Auto-Rejection** followed by recruiter courtesy email
- **Position filled notification** after initial rejection
- **Quarterly cleanup emails** for old applications
- **Multiple system notifications** from same company

### Required Documentation Elements

**MANDATORY LINK VALIDATION:** All job posting URLs must be tested using WebFetch tool to verify accessibility and current availability. Include verification date and status (ACTIVE/EXPIRED/INVALID) for each URL.

### Link Validation Tools and Methods

#### Required Tools for URL Verification
1. **WebFetch Tool:** Primary method for testing job posting URLs
   ```
   WebFetch: "[job-posting-url]" "Verify this job posting is still active and accessible"
   ```

2. **URL Testing Protocol:**
   - Test each job posting URL individually using WebFetch
   - Document response status (accessible, not found, redirected, etc.)
   - Note if URL leads to active job posting vs. generic company page
   - Record verification date in YYYY-MM-DD format

3. **Status Classification:**
   - **ACTIVE:** URL accessible, leads to specific job posting with application capability
   - **EXPIRED:** URL accessible but job posting removed or marked as closed
   - **INVALID:** URL not accessible, returns error, or leads to unrelated content
   - **REDIRECTED:** URL redirects to different page (note destination)

#### Link Validation Schedule
- **Initial Verification:** All URLs tested during initial job search execution
- **Pre-Application Verification:** Re-test URLs immediately before applying (within 24 hours)
- **Weekly Monitoring:** Re-verify high-priority opportunity URLs weekly
- **Monthly Archive Review:** Check status of all documented URLs monthly
