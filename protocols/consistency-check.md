## When to Use This Checklist
- After any changes to professional experience or positions
- When updating technical achievements or metrics
- Before important job applications or networking events
- Quarterly maintenance reviews
- After discovering any inconsistencies between documents

## Step-by-Step Update Process

### 1. Review Gold Standard References and Style Guidelines

- **Read Career Background:** Review `documentation/career-background.md` for comprehensive context, hidden expertise, and positioning insights
- **Read Style Guidelines:** Review `documentation/style-guide.md` for language preferences and communication approach
- **Note Current Status:** Current positions, dates, key metrics, and recent achievements
- **Understand Dual Approach:** Exact numbers in master resume, general language in presentation documents
- **Identify Propagation Needs:** New information from master resume and career background that should be reflected across ecosystem

### 2. Check ALL Resume Files for Consistency
Review each file against master resume and career background. **IMPORTANT:** Check ALL .md, .yaml, and .json files under ./resumes directory:

**Core Resume Variants:**

- Quantitative language follows style guide (general terms in presentation documents)

### 2a. Create/Update Specialized Single-Role Resumes with Matching Cover Letters
Create targeted resumes for each specific position type using master resume as authoritative source and career background for positioning insights. **CRITICAL:** Each specialized resume MUST have a matching cover letter with `-cover-letter` appended to the filename.

**Current Specialized Resumes (./resumes/specialized/):**
- [ ] `fractional-cto.md` + `fractional-cto-cover-letter.md` - Fractional CTO positioning with crisis resolution expertise
- [ ] `chief-solutions-architect.md` + `chief-solutions-architect-cover-letter.md` - Chief Solutions Architect focus emphasizing enterprise architecture mastery
- [ ] `enterprise-architect.md` + `enterprise-architect-cover-letter.md` - Enterprise Architect specialization highlighting Centers of Excellence leadership
- [ ] `vp-engineering.md` + `vp-engineering-cover-letter.md` - VP Engineering positioning with technical leadership emphasis
- [ ] `principal-solutions-architect.md` + `principal-solutions-architect-cover-letter.md` - Principal Solutions Architect focus with AI/ML innovation leadership
- [ ] `solution-architect.md` + `solution-architect-cover-letter.md` - Solution Architect positioning emphasizing framework development

- [ ] `MatthewWhited-Enterprise-Architect-Resume.md` + `MatthewWhited-Enterprise-Architect-Resume-cover-letter.md` - Enterprise Architect specialization
- [ ] **All other .md files in resumes/specialized/** - Check systematically for consistency with matching cover letters

**Cover Letter Requirements:**
- **Filename Convention:** [resume-name]-cover-letter.md (e.g., `platform-architect-cover-letter.md`)
- **Content Source:** Derived from master resume achievements and career background positioning
- **Role-Specific Focus:** Emphasize relevant experience and value proposition for specific position type
- **Professional Tone:** Follow style guide language preferences and communication approach

- **Primary Source:** All content must derive from `resumes/master-resume.md` as authoritative reference
- **Positioning Context:** Use `documentation/career-background.md` for role-specific emphasis and hidden expertise
- **Technical Accuracy:** Maintain exact technical claims and achievement metrics from master resume
- **Professional Identity:** Adapt multi-track positioning from career background to single-role focus
- **Complete Work History:** **MUST include complete employment chronology** from master resume - minimum of job titles and years for entire career, with role-relevant emphasis for key positions

### 4. Update ALL Profile Documents
Update all profile documents using master resume as authoritative source and career background for positioning. **IMPORTANT:** Check ALL .md files under ./profiles directory:

- [ ] `profiles/executive-summary.md` - Executive positioning using career background strategic context
- [ ] `profiles/introduction.md` - Professional introduction with master resume achievements
- [ ] **All other .md files in profiles/** - Check systematically for consistency with current Principal Solutions Architect positioning

**Source-Based Update Requirements:**
- **Master Resume Integration:** All achievements, metrics, and professional history must derive from master resume
- **Career Background Positioning:** Professional identity and strategic positioning should reflect career background insights
- **Single Title Profile Focus:** Profile documents must target single title (Chief Solutions Architect) - no multi-title positioning
- **Current Position Context:** Update "What I'm Working On" sections with latest information from master resume

- **Style Alignment:** Apply general quantitative language per style guide (650K+ not 652,868+)
- **Natural Language:** Use conversational terms maintaining master resume accuracy

### 5. Verify Position Information Consistency
Ensure across ALL documents using master resume as authoritative source:

**Employment History Verification:**
- **Current Position:** Green Onion (February 2025 - Present) appears first chronologically per master resume
- **Recent Positions:** ERisk Services, Eliassen Group dates and details match master resume exactly
- **Complete Work History:** All positions from master resume properly represented with accurate dates
- **Out-of-Band Development:** Independent consulting (March 2015 - Present) properly positioned per master resume
- **Achievement Language:** Conservative, professional tone maintaining master resume accuracy
- **Technical Claims:** All validated against master resume technical innovation portfolio
- **Career Background Integration:** Position descriptions enhanced with career background context where appropriate
- **Multi-Track Positioning:** Each document reflects appropriate positioning (executive vs. strategic) from career background

### 6. Update Documentation
- [ ] Add entry to `../documentation/change-history-YYYYMMDD.md` (use current date) with changes made
- [ ] Update `../CLAUDE.md` with session summary and current status
- [ ] Note any new information learned for future master resume updates
- [ ] Document any career background insights that should be reflected in future resume updates
- [ ] Record any positioning discoveries that enhance professional identity across ecosystem

## Common Issues to Watch For
- **Position Ordering:** Current position should appear first
- **Date Accuracy:** Ensure all start/end dates are correct
- **Metric Consistency:** Use "substantial" instead of specific percentages
- **Missing Positions:** New roles should appear in all relevant documents
- **Technical Currency:** Skills and achievements should reflect latest work
- **Quantitative Language:** Exact numbers only in master resume, general language elsewhere
- **Style Violations:** Corporate speak, exact precision, or overly technical jargon
- **Natural Flow:** Ensure conversational, authentic tone throughout

## Comprehensive File Discovery Commands

```bash
# Find ALL resume files that need checking
find resumes/ -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.txt"

# Find ALL profile files that need checking  
find profiles/ -name "*.md"

# Check for specific file types in resumes directory

for resume in $(find resumes/specialized/ -name "*.md" ! -name "*-cover-letter.md"); do
  cover_letter="${resume%-*.md}-cover-letter.md"
  if [[ ! -f "$cover_letter" ]]; then
    echo "Missing cover letter: $cover_letter for resume: $resume"
  fi
done

# List all targeted files specifically
find resumes/targeted/ -name "*.md" | sort
```

## Quick Verification Commands
Use these to spot-check consistency across ALL discovered files:

find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "Green Onion.*Present" {} \;
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "ERisk.*2025" {} \;

# Verify target job title consistency (should be Principal Solutions Architect in non-master files)
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" ! -name "master-resume.md" -exec grep -l "Principal Solutions Architect" {} \;
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" ! -name "master-resume.md" -exec grep -l "Fractional CTO" {} \; # Should be minimal

# Check quantitative language compliance across ALL markdown files
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "657K" {} \;  # Should appear in presentation documents
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "657,373" {} \;  # Should only appear in master-resume.md

# Verify Principal Solutions Architect positioning across files
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "Platform Architecture Excellence" {} \;

find resumes/ -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.txt" | wc -l
find profiles/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
```

### 2. Positioning Consistency Validation
```bash
# Verify Principal Solutions Architect is primary target (except master resume)
find resumes/ profiles/ -name "*.md" ! -name "master-resume.md" -exec grep -L "Principal Solutions Architect" {} \;  # Should return no results

# Verify master resume contains all target titles
grep -c "Principal Solutions Architect\|Fractional CTO\|Principal Platform Architect" resumes/master-resume.md  # Should be 3+
```

### 3. Spot-Check Random Files
1. Select 3-4 random files from different directories for manual review
2. Verify current position appears first in all chronological listings
3. Confirm contact information is current across all documents
4. Check quantitative language compliance (657K+ vs exact numbers)
5. Verify Platform Architecture Excellence positioning in core differentiators

### 4. Specialized Resume Cover Letter Validation
```bash
# Check that all specialized resumes have matching cover letters
for resume in $(find resumes/specialized/ -name "*.md" ! -name "*-cover-letter.md"); do
  cover_letter="${resume%-*.md}-cover-letter.md"
  if [[ ! -f "$cover_letter" ]]; then
    echo "MISSING: $cover_letter for resume: $resume"
  else
    echo "FOUND: Cover letter pair for $(basename $resume)"
  fi
done

# Count specialized resumes vs cover letters
resume_count=$(find resumes/specialized/ -name "*.md" ! -name "*-cover-letter.md" | wc -l)
cover_letter_count=$(find resumes/specialized/ -name "*-cover-letter.md" | wc -l)
echo "Specialized resumes: $resume_count, Cover letters: $cover_letter_count"
```

### 5. Comprehensive File Alignment Check
