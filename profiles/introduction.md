# Hello, I'm Matthew Whited

I'm a Principal Solutions Architect with a passion for architecting enterprise-scale AI/ML solutions and solving complex technical challenges that drive real business impact. With over 20 years in software development and system architecture, I've had the privilege of designing and implementing everything from embedded microcontrollers to production AI/ML infrastructure serving millions of users.

## What Drives Me

I love architecting complex systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge innovation and practical enterprise solutions. There's something deeply satisfying about understanding systems from the hardware foundation up to cloud-scale AI/ML infrastructure. My background in electronics engineering gives me a unique perspective on performance optimization and system design that I bring to every enterprise architecture challenge.

## My Journey

My career started with electronics and embedded systems, which taught me to think about efficiency, resource constraints, and system-level performance optimization. This foundation has been invaluable as a Principal Solutions Architect, where those same principles apply at enterprise scale. Whether I'm architecting AI/ML infrastructure, designing custom database extensions, or optimizing queries for million-record datasets, it's all about understanding the fundamental building blocks and how they compose into scalable solutions.

## What I'm Architecting

Currently, I'm leading enterprise cloud architecture optimization initiatives at Green Onion (Life Time Foundation), where I'm achieving substantial cost reductions (77%+ in some cases) through comprehensive architecture review and system redesign. As a Principal Solutions Architect, I'm particularly focused on AI/ML infrastructure design, semantic search architectures, and high-performance vector database implementations. 

I've architected custom SQLCLR extensions for SQL Server that have been downloaded over 650,000 times across my 20 NuGet packages - it's incredibly rewarding to see enterprise teams adopting these architectural patterns and tools. My solutions range from performance-critical command-line frameworks to specialized enterprise systems for electronic scoring and radiation monitoring. My vector search architecture extensions are being used in production enterprise systems, and I'm working with sentence transformer models to architect fuzzy matching solutions at scale. It's fascinating how we can now architect systems that understand semantic meaning, not just perform text matching.

## My Architecture Philosophy

As a Principal Solutions Architect, I believe in:
- **Enterprise-Scale Architecture** - Designing frameworks and patterns that scale across organizations and enable teams to build consistently
- **Knowledge Transfer Leadership** - I've run .NET boot camps and AI training programs because architectural knowledge sharing is crucial for organizational scaling
- **Deep Technical Implementation** - Whether it's developing custom database extensions or debugging distributed systems, I maintain hands-on technical depth alongside architectural vision
- **Domain-Specific Excellence** - From enterprise AI/ML systems to specialized industrial applications, I excel at translating complex business requirements into technical architecture
- **Continuous Innovation** - Architecture evolves rapidly, and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies like AI/ML is essential for strategic guidance

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding, I'm often working on personal electronics projects - I've designed my own complete 16-bit microprocessor (MW16C) in SystemVerilog with a multi-stage pipeline, comprehensive instruction set, and a Python assembler. My EmbeddedBakery repository has over 200+ commits spanning comprehensive VHDL component libraries, SystemVerilog CPU implementations, and embedded C/C++ projects. I also enjoy photography and have been experimenting with AI-powered image analysis and cataloging systems using production ML infrastructure with Docker orchestration (SBERT, ViT, Ollama, Qdrant).

I'm active in the developer community with 22K+ reputation on Stack Overflow from 600+ solutions spanning 15+ years of helping fellow developers reach nearly 5 million users. I've been recognized as a GitHub Arctic Code Vault Contributor with 30+ repositories and achievements including Pull Shark (x2), Quickdraw, YOLO, and Starstruck, which feels like a small part of preserving digital history.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow architects and technologists to discuss everything from enterprise AI/ML architecture design to the latest developments in vector databases and transformer model implementations.
