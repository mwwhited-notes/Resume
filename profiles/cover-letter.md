With over 20 years of experience spanning enterprise software development, AI/ML infrastructure, platform engineering, and technical leadership, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's continued success.

## What I Bring to Your Organization

**Technical Excellence & Platform Innovation**
My recent work includes pioneering vector search capabilities for SQL Server, implementing AI-powered semantic search systems, and achieving 77% reduction in cloud infrastructure costs through platform architecture optimization. My open-source contributions demonstrate significant platform engineering impact: 796K+ downloads across 42 NuGet packages, including specialized command-line frameworks and infrastructure tools for electronic scoring systems and radiation monitoring. I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical platform solutions that scale across organizations.

**Platform Leadership & Team Development**
As a Centers of Excellence Lead influencing 125+ developers, I have established comprehensive professional development programs, including .NET Boot Camps and AI training initiatives. I believe in building strong platform engineering teams through knowledge sharing and structured mentorship, creating sustainable technical excellence and platform reliability that extends beyond individual projects.

**Full-Stack Platform Engineering**
My unique background combines enterprise platform architecture with embedded systems and electronics engineering. My EmbeddedBakery repository showcases comprehensive hardware description language projects in Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, and C/C++, including custom 16-bit microprocessor designs. This broad perspective allows me to optimize platform solutions across the entire technology stack, from database performance tuning to infrastructure automation, ensuring both immediate impact and long-term platform scalability.

## Recent Platform Engineering Achievements
