```csharp
public string GetRandomString(int length)
{
    var newBuffer = new byte[length];
    if (length <= 0)
        return null;

    var charSet = ("ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ" +
                   "abcdefghijkmnprstuvxyz" +
                   "23456789").ToCharArray();

    using (var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())
    {
        rng.GetBytes(newBuffer);
        var newChars = newBuffer.Select(b => charSet[b % charSet.Length]).ToArray();
        return new string(newChars);
    }
}
```
**Analysis:** Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of:
- Cryptographically secure random number generation vs. basic Random class
- Proper resource disposal with using statements
- LINQ for data transformation
- Custom character set configuration avoiding confusing characters
- Input validation and edge case handling

#### 2. **Low-Level Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Conversion**
```csharp
char[] str = "12345".ToCharArray();
int num = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < str.Length; i++)
{
    var val = str[str.Length -1 - i] - 48;
    if (val < 0 || val > 9) 
        throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
    num += val << (4 * i);
}
```
**Analysis:** Shows deep understanding of:
- Bit manipulation and shifting operations
- ASCII character encoding (subtracting 48 to convert to numeric)
- Binary Coded Decimal representation
- Proper error handling for invalid input
- Performance optimization through bit operations

#### 3. **Advanced LINQ to XML Data Transformation**
```csharp
var orders = from row in table.Rows.Cast<DataRow>()
             let item = new
             {
                 OrderID = row[0],
                 Account = row[1],
                 ItemID = row[999],
                 Price = row[998],
             }
             group item by new { item.OrderID, item.Account };

var xml = new XElement("orders",
    from order in orders
    select new XElement("order",
        new XAttribute("id", order.Key.OrderID),
        new XAttribute("account", order.Key.Account),
        new XElement("items",
            from item in order
            select new XElement("item",
                new XAttribute("id", item.ItemID),
                new XAttribute("price", item.Price)
            )
        )
    )
);
```
